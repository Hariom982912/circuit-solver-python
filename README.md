# Circuit Solver Web App 🔌

This is a simple and interactive web app to simulate **RC, RL, and RLC circuits**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The app also plots graphs using basic JS and visualization techniques.

## 🔧 Features
- Solve **Resistor-Capacitor (RC)** circuits
- Solve **Resistor-Inductor (RL)** circuits
- Solve **Resistor-Inductor-Capacitor (RLC)** circuits
- Interactive user input for R, L, C, and time
- Real-time plotting of current/voltage using HTML canvas
